# CoinclickRGBRollercoinbot
just a simple bot that uses RGB to automate mouse clicks i will include the refrence image files to use for the Rollercoin coinclick game
you can use a website like https://www.ginifab.com/feeds/pms/color_picker_from_image.php to pull the selected RGB colors from the 
included images feel free to edit the code to your preferences make sure you enter the RGB color in the following format "255,153,49"
without quotes and click the update button to run the code you can enter up to 7 RGB values you can test it on any game such as fps
i simply used the coinclick game as an example
